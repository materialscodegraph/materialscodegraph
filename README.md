# MaterialsCodeGraph - Project Overview

## Project Vision

MaterialsCodeGraph is an AI-powered simulation platform designed to democratize advanced materials research by removing friction between atomistic simulations and device-level performance modeling. The platform bridges the gap from atoms to answers, placing sophisticated multiphysics capabilities in the hands of every scientist and engineer designing matter at the nanoscale.

## Core Problem Statement

Modern materials research faces significant fragmentation:

- **Format Incompatibility**: Researchers waste valuable time scripting conversions between Materials Project, VASP, LAMMPS, and Quantum ESPRESSO formats
